# Stock Prediction Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict stock prices. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features
1. **Data Collection**: Fetch historical stock price data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for analysis.
3. **Model Training**: Use machine learning algorithms to train predictive models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using various metrics.
5. **Visualization**: Plot and visualize stock price trends and predictions.

## Key Components
- **Data Collection**:
  - Dataset Link -> (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sakshamprajapati/Stock-Market-ML/main/AXISBANK.csv)
  
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values.
  - Normalize data for better model performance.
  
- **Model Training**:
  - Implement algorithms like Linear Regression, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), etc.
  
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Calculate RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
  
- **Visualization**:
  - Plot actual vs. predicted stock prices using matplotlib.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project consists of historical stock prices, including the following features:
- **Date**: The date of the stock price entry.
- **Open**: The price at which the stock opened.
- **High**: The highest price of the stock on that day.
- **Low**: The lowest price of the stock on that day.
- **Close**: The closing price of the stock.
- **Volume**: The number of shares traded on that day.

The data is retrieved from APIs like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance. Ensure you have API access to retrieve the data.

## How to Use
1. **Setup**:
   - Install required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`.
   
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow
